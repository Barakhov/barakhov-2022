			<p>Wha, me irresponsible ?! All I wanted you to do was to hand me a screwdriver, Morty! Oh, that's Million Ants. I can't see the ants from over here, I just assumed that was um.. Turd Man, Wiggly Turd Man. I can finally go on that trip I've been talking about. Burgertime!</p>

I don't get it, and I don't need to.</p>
